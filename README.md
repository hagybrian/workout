# functional(Hypertrphy)

Functional Hypertrophy in fitness is a blend of training for strength and size. functional(Hypertrphy) is a weightlifting tracking app where users record their progress in Phases by body section (Chest & Back, Legs, and Arms). Every weight, rep, and tempo is recorded so users can view historical data to ensure every body section is worked out evenly to prevent major strength differences by body section.
